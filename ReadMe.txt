LinkedList Cw2 - ReadMe
This application is supposed to create a linked-list for storing int data. The classes we have to build
are making modifications on it such as "pop" , "append" , etc.
It is also includes a method to delete the whole list or performing a deep copy of every node, add, push and so on.

To compile the application you have to type 'nmake' in the command line prompt, to get the application build , library and objects made 
as well as linking the files.
After the compiling is done you type 'test' to check which of the tests are passed or failed.
The makefile includes a clean section as well. Type 'nmake clean' tp delete .obj and .exe files. 

The application was made by using Notepad++, Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 and Microsoft compiler.
